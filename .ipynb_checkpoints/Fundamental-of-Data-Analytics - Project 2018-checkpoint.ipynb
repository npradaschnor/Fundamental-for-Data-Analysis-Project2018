    "Since 1969 box plot has been used and probably is one of the most used type of graphic  as it is a very effective and easy to read [1,5, 8]. \n",
    "A box plot is a standardized method for displaying the distribution of data based on their quartiles (minimum, first quartile Q1, median, third quartile Q3 and maximum) [2,4]. That way, a box plot summarizes the distribution of data from multiple sources in a single graph [1, 5].\n",

    "A box plot allows the comparison of data from different categories and gives a range of information, such as shape, center (median) and variability of a data set and it makes easier for decision-making [5, 6]."

The end of the box represents the upper and lower quartiles (75th and 25th percentiles). The extreme lines (whiskers) represent the maximum and minimum value not including the outliers number [1].\n",

    "# Alternatives to box plot\n",
    "\n",
    "A box plot is a good statistical graph, however it shows only a simple summary of the distribution of a data. So, it is not the best method for detailed analysis. As box plot can hide some details of a distribution and even showing if a data set is symmetric, it cannot tell the shape of the symmetry. Therefore, to examine those details it should be used in combination with another statistical graph method, such as a histogram and/or a stem and leaf display [1, 3, 6]."
