In this repository you will find the project in the notebook file named :open_file_folder: [Fundamental-of-Data-Analytics - Project 2018.ipynb](https://github.com/npradaschnor/Fundamental-for-Data-Analysis-Project2018/blob/master/Fundamental-of-Data-Analytics%20-%20Project%202018.ipynb) with investigation about box plots. The investigation about box plots includes the following steps: 


• Summarise the history of the box plot and situations in which it used. 
• Demonstrate the use of the box plot using data of your choosing. 
• Explain any relevant terminology such as the terms quartile and percentile. 
• Compare the box plot to alternatives.


The data set used to create examples of box plot is from [Integrated Mapping for the Sustainable Development of Ireland’s Marine Resource - INFOMAR](https://www.infomar.ie/), a *'twenty year programme to map the physical, chemical and biological features of Ireland’s seabed'*.
